This dissertation argues that early land reforms had consequential long-run impacts on the development of the American state. The state-building role of land reform, frequently discussed in the context of comparative political economy, is often overlooked in the study of American political development. I provide evidence that mid-nineteenth century homestead acts had significant long-run impacts that can help explain contemporary differences in the size of state governments. I find that homestead policy --- or the homestead entries authorized by homestead policy --- had significant and negative effects on the size of state governments lasting a century after passage of the 1862 Homestead Act. This finding implies that in the absence of homestead policy, the average size of frontier state governments would have been higher than eastern states that were not directly affected by homesteads. Potential causal mechanisms include land inequality, which I show to be positively correlated with state capacity, especially at higher levels of inequality. This empirical relationship is consistent with the theory that higher levels of inequality increases the likelihood of governments adopting new taxes to give wealthy landowners the ability to design a favorable tax structure. 

The dissertation makes a novel methodological contribution in proposing data-driven machine learning alternatives to the synthetic control method (SCM) for estimating the effect of a policy intervention on an outcome over time. The proposed method based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is less susceptible to $p$-hacking, as it does not require the researcher to choose predictors or pre-intervention covariates to construct the synthetic control. RNNs do not assume a functional form, can learn nonconvex combinations of control units, and are specifically structured to exploit temporal dependencies in sequential data.

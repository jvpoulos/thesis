\chapter{Introduction}

This dissertation argues that early land reforms had consequential long-run impacts on the development of the American state. The state-building role of land reform, which includes policies to decentralize public land, is frequently discussed in the context of comparative political economy. Several scholars of American Political Development (APD) have studied the implications of land policies designed to open up the western frontier on the developmental trajectory of the U.S. \citep[e.g.,][]{bensel1990,frymer2014rush}; however, this dissertation is the first to quantify how land policies shaped the developmental trajectory of the American political economy.

In the existing APD literature, substantial attention is paid to state-building with respect to the centralization of national power.  For instance, APD scholars trace the expansion of federal bureaucratic capacity through the merit-based federal civil service system installed in the aftermath of the American Civil War \citep{skowronek1982building,bensel1990,carpenter2001}. The American state, however, is organized horizontally and authority is often delegated downward to sub-national units of government. As \citet{novak2008myth} writes, ``trying to gauge the power of the American state or the reach of American public policy by looking simply at the national center or the federal bureaucracy is to miss where much of the action is --- on the local and state levels." How did public land laws shape the development of state governments?

This dissertation also contributes to the comparative politics literature concerned with land reform and state-building  \citep[e.g.,][]{albertus2015autocracy, murtazashvili2016does}. Land reform refers to policies designed to establish or redefine property institutions to increase land tenure, and includes policies such as land redistribution, land titling, and decentralization of public land. 

The essays included in this dissertation explore the consequences to two different mechanisms of public land decentralization in the 19th century U.S.: land lotteries and homestead policies. The latter offered a free land grant to citizens willing to build on an improve a plot of land of predetermined size for a number of years; land lotteries involved the random allocation of the right to file a land grant, without a homesteading requirement. Both were designed to rapidly populate the frontier with mostly white settlers, thereby reducing the costs of defending unsecured territory for a otherwise constrained national and sub-national governments \citep{frymer2014rush}.

\section{Land reform, inequality and state capacity}

Land reform is an important tool of state-building, which is broadly defined as efforts designed to strengthen weak nation-states states through political and economic reforms. It is generally argued in the state-building literature that greater economic power of the ruling class reduces investment in state capacity. State capacity refers not only to the ability to raise revenue, but also the stateâ€™s ability to implement policies such as public education through redistributive spending \citep{besley2010state}. The canonical model of \citet{meltzer1981rational} predicts a positive relationship between inequality and redistribution because greater inequality implies the median voter is poorer than the average voter, which in turn increases demand for redistribution in majority-rule elections. 

The canonical model assumes parity in the political influence of voters. However, economic differences in political influence can arise from the comparative advantage of economic elites in solving collective action problems and benefitting from political intervention \citep{acemoglu2008persistence}. Elites have higher education attainment and earnings abilities \citep{bourguignon2000oligarchy}, and their resource advantage and common interests enable them work toward similar policy goals \citep{winters2009}. 

Models that allow for differences in political influence across economic groups yield a nonlinearity in the relationship between inequality and redistribution. In \possessivecite{benabou2000unequal} model, for instance, the pivotal voter is wealthier than the median and has the power to block redistribution as inequality increases. But when inequality is too high, the poor can impose redistribution on elites through `universal' majority voting \citep{perotti1993political,saint1993education}. In \possessivecite{besley2009origins} framework, greater economic power of the ruling class reduces investment in state capacity. 

\citet{galor2009inequality} propose a model where wealthy landowners block education reforms because education favors industrial labor productivity at the expense of the agricultural sector. Their model implies education reforms will not occur where land is abundant and unequally distributed, and thereby delays the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy. However, land reforms that sufficiently reduce land inequality diminishes the economic incentives of landowners to block education reforms. 
%
%\citet{albertus2015autocracy} theorizes that the successful implementation of land reform requires sufficient administrative capacity, low institutional constraints, and a coalitional split between landowners and the ruling class that provides the ruling class with the incentive to pursue land reform. 

\subsection{``Hollowing out'' tax institutions}
	
Landed elites might choose an inefficient organization of the state in order to create inefficiencies in tax collection \citep{acemoglu2011emergence} or ``hollow-out'' tax institutions in order to constrain the state's ability to tax in the future \citep{suryanarayan2017hollowing}. Inequality in this context can be thought of as a proxy for the amount of \emph{de facto} political influence elites have to block reforms and limit the capacity of the state \citep{acemoglu2008persistence}.

\citet{mares2015non} argue that higher levels of land inequality increases the likelihood of adopting new taxes in order to give the landed elite the ability to design a tax structure that shifts the tax burden from the agricultural sector to the manufacturing sector. The authors show empirically that countries with high levels of land inequality are more likely to adopt the income tax.  Consistent with the findings of \citet{mares2015non}, I show that land inequality is positively related to state capacity, especially at higher levels of inequality. 

This finding is in contrast to several empirical studies that establish a negative relationship between land inequality and state capacity in the context of taxes, revenues, and public school spending at the county-level in 1890 and 1930. These studies are based on analyses over shorter time periods. \citet{ramcharan2010inequality}, for instance, finds an inverse relationship between land inequality and county-level property tax revenues in 1890. The authors find that the negative relationship is especially large in rural counties, where landownership tends to be more concentrated. \citet{vollrath2013inequality} establish a negative relationship between land inequality and local property tax revenues in 1890 in northern rural counties, but not in southern rural counties. 

\section{Culture and migration to the frontier}

It is commonly believed in the political economy literature that state capacity in general is easier to raise in more ethnically or culturally homogeneous societies \citep{besley2010state}. It has also long been viewed in by sociologists \citep{meyer1979public} and more recently, political economists \citep{alesina2013nation,bandiera2018nation}, that the rise of public schooling in the U.S. during the 19th century can be explained as a nation-building policy enacted primarily by state governments, which were the most active level of government in terms of public goods provision from 1790 to the 1840s \citep{wallis2000american}. \citet{bandiera2018nation}, for instance, argues that states adopted compulsory schooling laws as a nation-building tool to instill civic values to the millions of foreign migrants who arrived to the country between 1850 and 1914, during the `Age of Mass Migration.' 

During this time period, the frontier attracted foreign migrants along with workers from eastern U.S. cities, many of whom were the lower end of the skill distribution. \citet{bazzi2017frontier} find evidence that frontier settlers were disproportionately illiterate and foreign-born. The negative selection of westward migrants during this period is consistent with theory of the frontier as a `safety valve' for relieving congested urban labor markets in eastern states \citep{turner1956significance, ferrie1997migration}.

Beside the negative selection in terms of labor market skill, \citet{bazzi2017frontier} argue that the frontier attracted individualists who would be able to thrive in the harsh conditions characterizing the frontier experience; e.g., the social isolation due to low population density on the frontier. The authors find that counties with longer historical frontier experience exhibit lower contemporary property tax rates, and their citizens are more opposed to taxation and redistribution. 

\section{Land monopolization and rent-seeking on the frontier} 

A competing argument emerges from the dissertation that early land reform in the American case increased the economic power of elites by enabling speculators, railroad companies, and other corporations to scoop up huge swaths of valuable land and then act as passive rentiers.  

The U.S. frontier experienced a large-scale transformation of hundreds of millions of public frontier land into private property beginning with the passage of the Land Act of 1820, which permitted the direct sale of public land to private individuals of 80 acres or more for at least \$1.25 an acre, and accelerating after the passage of the homestead acts. About 150 million acres of public land, or about 7\% of the total area of frontier states, had already been sold by the time of the passage of the Homestead Act (HSA) of 1862.\footnote{Source: author's estimates using land patent data described in Section~\ref{state-capacity}.} By the turn of the twentieth century, 250 million acres (11\% of total land area) had been sold, while 100 million acres (4\% of total land area) had been claimed by homestead. In the South, about 50 million acres of public land, or about 31\% of the states' total acreage, had already been sold by before the passage of the Southern Homestead Act of 1866. A substantial rise in the number and total acreage, respectively, of homestead entries in the South and West occurred after the 1889 cash-entry restriction imposed by the U.S. Congress.

The large-scale transfer of public land to railroad companies may have accelerated the increase in frontier land inequality. Land near railroad tracks were often high quality and railroad companies sold excess land to speculators \citep{murtazashvili2013political}. Railroad companies were granted nearly 130 million acres of land between 1862 and 1871 by federal and state governments. About 20\% of the public domain was granted to states or sold or granted to railroads or other corporations, which is comparable to the amount of land granted or sold to homesteaders \citep{shanks2005homestead}.

Speculators and railroad companies worked together to secure state, county, and municipal grants for local railroads. In \possessivecite{gates1939land} study of Indiana counties, for example, speculators fought county governments subsidizing railroads --- despite possibly benefiting from the lines --- and the speculators' land reduced the tax base of the area, so that counties could not sell bonds to finance railroad subsidies. 

\section{``What the railroad will bring us''} 

Frontier states prioritized spending on banking and transportation projects in competition with each other to raise land values and attract more settlers \citep{sylla1998anatomy}. The promise of increasing land values and future tax revenues led frontier states to sharply increase borrowing in the mid-1830s by selling long-term bonds to finance transportation and banking investments. Frontier states in the Northwest (e.g., Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan) borrowed to invest in canals and railroads, while those in the South (e.g, Arkansas, Florida, and Mississippi) borrowed in order to charter state banks. Indiana, for instance, passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act in 1836 that added \$10 million in debt spending for transportation projects such as the Wabash and Erie Canal. The state also changed its property tax structure from a flat tax on land to an \emph{ad valorem} tax on all wealth in order to capture the expected increase in land values that would result from the projects \citep{wallis2004sovereign}. The Panic of 1837 decreased land values and put a hole in the state's tax revenue, causing the state to default on its debt and interest obligations.

Because railroads expanded commerce by making it cheaper to trade, railroad access is theoretically expected to increase returns to farm land, and in turn increase the property tax base. \citet{donaldson2016railroads}, for instance, find that average farm values increased substantially as the railroad network expanded from 1870 to 1890, and estimate that the absence of railroads would have decreased farm land values by 60\%. \citet{atack2011impact} attribute two-thirds of the increase in improved farm acreage in Midwestern states to the expansion of railroad access in the decade prior to the Civil War. As evidence that railroad access increases the property tax base through higher land values, \citet{atack2012impact} find school attendance rates increased in counties that gained access to the rail network between 1850 and 1860. 

\section{Counterfactual history}

Inferring causal relationships is a fundamental problem in history and the social sciences. The problem of causal inference is usually framed in terms of counterfactuals: outcomes that would have been observed had the path of history diverged \citep{lewis2013counterfactuals,pearl2009causality,imbens2015causal}. Historians frequently pose counterfactuals in terms of speculating about the `might-have-beens' of history, as it is put by  \citet{elster1978logic}:

\begin{quote}
``In a non-experimental and non-comparative discipline one can hardly discuss the
relative importance of causes without engaging in some kind of thought experiment where one removes successively and separately each of the causes in
question and evaluates what difference the absence of this cause would have
made to the phenomenon in question. Some historians have come to recognize,
therefore, that they have been talking counterfactually all the time without
recognizing it.''
\end{quote}

This dissertation focuses on counterfactual questions in observational studies, where interventions and outcomes have already been recorded. In observational studies, interventions are not randomly assigned and thus there is no ``reasoned basis for inference'' for evaluating counterfactuals, according to Fisherian view of causal inference \citep{fisher1935}. This absence of randomization has not prevented political scientists from reasoning about counterfactuals in comparative case studies \citep{fearon1991counterfactuals, tetlock1996counterfactual,abadie2010synthetic,abadie2015comparative}.% Economic historians have evaluated counterfactual questions such as, ``What would the U.S. economy have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads?'' using a ``social saving" methodology \citep{fogel1964railroads, donaldson2016railroads} or general equilibrium models \citep{williamson2008late}.

\section{Sample selection bias and covariate shift}
The problem of counterfactual analysis in observational studies is inevitably confronted with sample selection bias \citep{heckman1979sample} which arises because the units choose whether they are exposed to treatment, or because the researcher makes nonrandom sample selection decisions. In either case, inferences on observed samples are biased because they differ from what we would infer on random samples from the population. 

The observational study in Chapter \ref{ga-lottery} makes the case that bias due to self-selection is ignorable because the treatment in the study -- winning land in the first two Georgia land lotteries --- was perfectly randomized by the state of Georgia; i.e., it is a true ``natural experiment.'' In Chapters \ref{land-reform} and \ref{rnns-causal}, it is acknowledged that treatment --- exposure to homestead policy or homestead entries authorized by those policies --- is not randomly assigned and units have selected into treatment. Both of these studies approach the problem of causal inference by counterfactual prediction via machine learning methods. The machine learning methods predict counterfactual outcomes of the treated units, which are then compared to the observed outcomes for estimating casual effects. These methods are data-driven, in that they do not require domain knowledge or pre-intervention covariates to generate counterfactual outcomes.  

In machine learning terms, the sample selection bias problem occurs when test set data are drawn from a true distribution and training data are drawn from a biased distribution, where the support of biased distribution is included in that of the true distribution \citep{cortes2008sample}. The sample selection bias problem is a special case of the covariate shift problem, when the distributions of training and test sets differ \citep{bickel2007discriminative}. 

The problem of causal inference by counterfactual prediction assumes that the training set (i.e., control unit observations) and test set (i.e., treated unit observations) are drawn from the same distribution and therefore, requires inference on a different distribution than training set. The approach described in Chapter \ref{rnns-causal} reweights the training loss function by the propensity score \citep{rosenbaum1983central}.\footnote{Note that the propensity score reweighting of the training loss can also be used to correct for the fact that treatment propensity increases over time in staggered treatment adoption settings, such as in Chapter \ref{land-reform}.} This correction technique, along with other regularization approaches, prevent the model from learning an overreliance on certain control units or time periods when generalizing from the factual to counterfactual domains \citep{johansson2016learning}.
	
\section{Overview}

The dissertation is comprised of the following three essays on the political economy of the American frontier. 

\subsection{State-Building through Public Land Disposal? An Application of Matrix Completion for Counterfactual Prediction}
The essay applies a matrix completion method to predict the counterfactual time-series of frontier state capacity had there been no homestead acts. Causal estimates signify that homestead policies had significant and long-lasting negative impacts on state government expenditure and revenue that lasted a century following their implementation. These results are similar to difference-in-difference (DID) estimates that exploit variation in the timing and intensity of homestead entries aggregated from 1.46 million individual land patent records.

The direction of these estimates align with the view that homestead policies were exploited by land speculators and natural resource companies and that the rents from public land were appropriated by the private sector. I explore land inequality as a possible causal mechanism underlying the relationship between land reform and state capacity, and provide evidence of a positive relationship between land inequality and state government finances and that the slope of correlation increases at higher levels of inequality. I also present DID estimates that reveal per-capita homesteads significantly lowered land inequality in frontier states. The negligible magnitude of the effect suggests that the homesteads did not sufficiently lower land inequality on the frontier, which can explain the negative impacts on state capacity. 

This essay makes a methodological contribution in applying matrix completion for estimating causal impacts of policy interventions on panel data. The method can be easily understood within the framework of modern causal inference, is adaptable to settings with staggered treatment adoption, and outperforms several other regression-based estimators in a battery of placebo tests.

\subsection{Land Lotteries, Long-term Wealth, and Political Selection} 
This essay asks whether personal wealth can cause individuals to select into office. This question is important and relevant because wealthy individuals might select into office in order to use their power to protect vested interests rather than advance the interests of their constituents. While several studies have studied the effect of officeholding on wealth accumulation, research on the extent to which personal wealth affects the probability of officeholding is much more limited.

The essay takes advantage of the random assignment of land in Georgia at the beginning of the nineteenth century. This random assignment of land generates a meaningful ex-ante exogenous shock to personal wealth, which is expected to reduce the opportunity costs of holding office and may make it more important for the wealthy to hold office. I find no evidence in support of the hypotheses that wealth increases the probability of running for office or holding office and argue that these null results are informative because the estimated effects are not practically different than zero. The absence of a treatment effect suggests that observed cross-sectional correlations between wealth and officeholding are likely due to selection effects. 

\subsection{RNN-Based Counterfactual Prediction, with an Application to Homestead Policy and Public Schooling}

This essay makes a methodological contribution in proposing a novel alternative to the SCM for estimating the effect of a policy intervention on an outcome over time. The proposed method based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is less susceptible to $p$-hacking because it does not require the researcher to choose predictors or pre-intervention covariates to construct the synthetic control. Moreover, RNNs do not assume a functional form, can learn nonconvex combinations of control units, and are specifically structured to exploit temporal dependencies in sequential data.

The RNN-based estimators require sufficient pre-period observations in order to learn an informative representation of the control units, and consequently perform comparatively worse than the SCM on small-dimensional datasets such as those featured in the original synthetic control papers. The RNN-based methods outperform the SCM in high-dimensional data settings when the number of pre-intervention time periods exceeds the number of control units.

In the empirical application, I estimate the causal impacts of the HSA on state government education spending. I find that homestead policy had positive long-run impacts on public education spending, although the impacts are not statistically significant when averaging across the entire post-intervention period. Time-specific causal estimates suggest that the HSA had positive and significant impacts on state government education spending fifty years after the first homestead entry in 1869. The estimated increase in education spending attributable to homestead policy translates to about 3\% of the total school expenditures per-capita in 1929.
